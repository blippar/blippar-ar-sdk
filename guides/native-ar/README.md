#Â Native AR

The following guides indicate the various modes supported by the Blippar SDK when using ARKit and ARCore (Native AR).

To run Native AR see the [requirements for running Native AR](native-ar-prerequisites.md).

[Marker-based SLAM](marker-slam.md) is a mode which is similar to traditional marker-based operation but when you move away from the marker the content will stay in the same place, using ARKit and ARCore's VIO system. Read more about this mode [here](marker-slam.md)
