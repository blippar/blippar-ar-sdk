# Blippar SDK 2.2.1 Release notes

## **Major Changes**

* A bug fix for the Android SDK 64-bit image rendering issue: fixing an issue with resized images not rendering correctly on 64-bit client apps.
* The beta release of the Blippar hub.

## The Beta Release of the Blippar Hub

The current Blippar hub has been out there for quite some time. Since it was released it has been evolving together with user requirements. Still to provide an even better user experience and faster UI we need to bring a bigger change to the hub. So we would like to present you the new, updated and improved Blippar blipps hub: [https://blipps.blippar.com/](https://blipps.blippar.com/). The new hub can be accessed using your current hub credentials.

For more information about the new Blippar hub and how to use it please check the [Blipp Publishing](../../guides/sdk-blipp-publishing.md) guide for more.

## **Breaking API changes**

None

## **Bugfixes**

* We received reports from some of our SDK users that in several cases parts of their blipps were missing or were not displayed correctly during the campaign playback. After an investigation, we have discovered an issue with image rendering on the 64-bit Android Blippar SDK compilations. This patch fixes the issue.
